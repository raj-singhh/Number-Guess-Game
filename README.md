**Guess the Number Game**

I developed a "Guess the Number" game using Java, focusing on core programming concepts and interactive console-based gameplay. The game includes the following features:

Simple Console Interface: A clean and straightforward command-line interface for user input and game feedback.

Random Number Generation: Utilized Java's random number generator to select a target number within a specified range.

Player Interaction: The player is prompted to guess the number, with feedback provided after each attempt (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low").

Game Loop: A robust game loop that continues until the correct number is guessed, ensuring responsive and accurate feedback.

Attempts Tracking: Tracks the number of attempts taken by the player to guess the correct number, displayed at the end of the game.

Play Again Option: Offers the player an option to play another round without restarting the program.

This project showcases my skills in Java programming, including random number generation, control structures, loops, and handling user input for a smooth gameplay experience.
